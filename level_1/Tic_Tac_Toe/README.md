A simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The user plays as 'X' and the computer plays as 'O'.

## Features

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal in the `src` directory.
3. Run the game:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## How to Play
- Enter a number from 1 to 9 to select your move (positions correspond to the board):

```
1 | 2 | 3
4 | 5 | 6
7 | 8 | 9
